HOMEWORK - v1.0
This is my Homework project

Contents in this package:
hw.py - It is the main file which can be used to record a day's homework

Accessibility:
It is reccomended to use thins file in a seperate folder, in any place of your computer
because the hw.py file creates a new text per day, thus you will need a seperate folder for better organizing

Features:
The version 1.0 is the first model of Homework Application.
This asks an input of the available homeworks from different subjects,
and creates and opens a file in that date and records the homework information

v2.0 Update:
The v2.0 will cover a major part of Disadvatages of v1.0 like to prevent overwriting when the application is run twice.
